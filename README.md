## RockstarsApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.1.
For setting up Angular, click [here](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart).

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Further help
